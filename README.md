# Ender 3/Ender 3 Pro Cable Chain v2 - 10 Deg Mount Parts 

# Summary

The Ender 3 Pro and later variants have an angled bed cable.  There are various cable links designed to alleviate stress on the cables themselves.  This project modifies some parts of existing designs to account for the 10 deg angle.


# Design

I'm using /u/johnniewhiskey 's [Cable Chain mod](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2920060) on the Ender 3 Pro.  Specifically, their v3 type links.  

This package tailors the [10 degree bed mount clip](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3162517) by Ryguitar07's to be compatible with the new links.  I have also shortened the offset of the original cableChain_40MountSide_v2 to compensate for the space taken by the angled mount. 

You can edit the source files on Tinkercad.
